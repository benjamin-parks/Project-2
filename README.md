# Paws & Claws Animal Adoption Application

Welcome to Paws and Claws, an intuitive and user-friendly animal adoption application designed to help animals find their forever homes. Our platform connects potential pet adopters with a variety of rescued animals, making the adoption process seamless and efficient. This is project 2 for the U of M Coding Bootcamp. The challenge was to build a real-world interactive full-stack application using everything we have learned over the past 6 modules.

## Key Features
Users:
- **User Registration and Profiles:** Users can create profiles, save favorite animals for future reference, and submit adoption inquiry applications.
- **Browse and Search:** Explore a wide range of animals available for adoption.
- **Detailed Animal Profiles:** Each animal has a comprehensive profile with name, photo, and description
- **Adoption Application:** Users can fill out and submit adoption applications directly through the platform, streamlining the process.
  
Employees:
- **Employee Management:** Manage user accounts and permissions, ensuring secure access and control over sensitive information.
- **Animal Management:** Easily add, update, or remove animal profiles with detailed information and photos.
- **Application Management:** Review and process adoption applications efficiently.
