# Paws & Claws Animal Adoption Application

Welcome to Paws and Claws, an intuitive and user-friendly animal adoption application designed to help animals find their forever homes. Our platform connects potential pet adopters with a variety of rescued animals, making the adoption process seamless and efficient. This is project 2 for the U of M Coding Bootcamp. The challenge was to build a real-world interactive full-stack application using everything we have learned over the past 6 modules.

## Key Features
Users:
- **Browse and Search:** Explore a wide range of animals available for adoption.
- **Detailed Animal Profiles:** Each animal has a comprehensive profile with name, photo, and description
- **Adoption Application:** Users can fill out and submit adoption applications directly through the platform, streamlining the process.
  
Employees:
- **Employee Management:** Manage user accounts and permissions, ensuring secure access and control over sensitive information.
- **Animal Management:** Easily add, update, or remove animal profiles with detailed information and photos.
- **Application Management:** Review and process adoption applications efficiently.

## Roadmap
We here at Paws and Claws plan to add a user login to better customize the experience. We also plan on adding a favorite page so you can favorite the animals that are up for adoption, so you can come back later and still have the animals that you had previously looked at right in front of you. We also plan on adding a function that will allow employees to easily add images to new animals that are up for adoption.
